# *The Freedom Report* Podcast

## Description

*The Freedom Report* is a political activism podcast held on itunes and podbean, and later published on youtube. It is a bi-weekly publication that airs every Monday and Wednesday. It is hosted by Austin Petersen, who is a former Presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, television producer, actor. He is currently the owner of the news/opinion website, [thelibertarianrepublic.com](thelibertarianrepublic.com), and [Stonegait Institute](http://stonegaitinstitute.org). The podcast takes many different forms; including: interview style, op-ed style, and bullet point style, all of which I will cover in this analysis.

## Interview Style: "Libertarians & The Military ft. Larry Sharpe"

### Organization
This episode begins with an introduction to the show, and then to Petersen's guest on the show, Larry Sharpe. Petersen asks Sharpe to give a more detailed introduction to himself, and he begins with a background to his childhood. Then he moves into his experience in the military. He says that his time in the military was a positive experience, and that "the military was good to me." This leads directly into a discussion regarding a current issue within the Libertarian Party. The party's vice chairman, Arvin Vohra, made some disparaging comments toward members of the military earlier that week. The two men discussed the comments and the aftermath of them at length. They agreed in the end that Vohra should be removed from his position. After this discussion, the conversation shifted to other topics that "actually matter," as Petersen put it. The episode moved to more of a rapid-fire question/answer segment on more broad, macro issues facing the military. These included the war and terror, the crisis with the VA, and the threats made by North Korea. The episode ended with Petersen giving Sharpe an opportunity to tell the listeners where they could find out more about him and what he does.

### Style

This particular episode was very vanilla. Meaning it was lacking in the effects department. The content was solely back and forth banter between the two men with no intro, outro, or interlude sounds or music.

### Narrative Type

As stated earlier, this was formatted as an interview. There was a primary question being asked by Petersen, and that was of Sharpe's thoughts on Arvin Vohra's statements. In a few occasions, Petersen would challenge Sharpe on a position he took, or ask him to clarify something he said earlier. So, in that way, it was not a "pure" interview. Towards the end, Petersen asked Sharpe questions that were requested by fans of the show. This again breaks the mold to some degree as to what a traditional interview is.

## Op-ed Style: "Trump Proposes Privatizing Air Traffic Control: Pros and Cons"

### Organization

This edition opens with the same introduction to the show as always, the only difference is the date of publication that is stated. After that, Petersen gives an overview of the current event he will be covering. He goes over his initial reaction to the story and what he discovered upon doing more research. He shares some of that research with the audience as he reads through an article from *The Washington Post*. As he reads the piece, he momentarily stops reading to give his listeners either his reaction to what he read, or a different angle that is not covered originally. He then pulls an article about the same subject from Florida Tech, and does the same thing. This article goes through the pros and cons to privatizing the FAA in the authors opinion. Naturally, Petersen disagrees with the writer on a few of his point, and a rather hefty does of sardonic humor is applied in his analysis. Once he is finished with the article, he gives his own broad opinion on the issue, and invites his audience to share their own opinions. He also encourages them to spread his podcast around the internet. The podcast ends with a few notes to his more ardent fans about events coming up in the future.

### Style

Much like the interview podcast, this one was light on extra sound effects. The introduction did not consist of music as many do, but of simply his usual introduction line. The one and only "sound effect" (if it might be called that) is the sound of police sirens in the background of his set. He uses these to makes a joke about people spelling his name with an "o" and not and "e," and subsequently being taken away by the police.

### Narrative Type

This edition of *The Freedom Report* differs from the one I covered earlier in the sense that is has a defined purpose of informing the audience of current events, and introducing an opinion to them. As a result, there are no questions, except rhetorical questions. Petersen uses his time on this episode picking apart two articles, rather than the person on the other end of a direct conversation. He also gives opinions on broader subjects that regard the one at hand.

## Bullet-Point Style: "7 Ways Liberals Are Helping Trump Get Reelected"

### Organization

In many ways, this episode is similar to the previous example, but there are some differences that warrant its own category. One significant difference about this one as opposed to the others (though it has nothing to do with presentation format), is that there are a couple of moments where Petersen pauses to say a word about his sponsors. Once that is taken care of, he welcomes his audience back and resumes the show. Similar to the previous episode, he selects an article that has been written recently and reacts to it. This time it is from the *Independent Journal Review*, and highlights, in the writer's opinion, how the American modern liberal movement is working against itself in regards to Donald Trump. Petersen moves through each point the author makes, and either refutes, elaborates, or provides further insight to each. The biggest thing that sets this apart from the podcast about the FAA is that it is not targeted at a specific current event. Nor is it intended in any way to educate the audience. It is openly trying to convince the audience of something. This episode concludes with Petersen asking his audience to share with him their "ideas for advancing liberty" in America.

### Style

It has become quite obvious to be now that *The Freedom Report* could use some real help in the way of sound management. Again, this episode is very vanilla and offers no real additions in regards to audio aesthetics. The only previously recorded sound that is in the podcast is his recordings of his sponsor pitches. But that certainly couldn't be considered a "sound effect." In fact, it probably has the opposite effect on his audience that a good selection of sounds/music would.

### Narrative Type

As previously stated, the purpose of this edition was to attempt and convince the audience of the validity of an opinion. Therefore, the one giving the opinion will want as large as an audience as possible to try and persuade. Petersen creates this by using a format that has become popular on the internet lately; one that I have decided to call the "bullet-point" style. Many websites are using titles starting with "9 ways..." or "10 reasons..." and so on. For reasons I can't explain, this has been proven to provoke people on the internet into clicking on and reading/listening to the website's content.
